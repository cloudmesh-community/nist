  title: Batch Job
  description: |-
  
    Computing jobs that can run without end user interaction, and are
    scheduled through queuing systems, are called batch jobs. Batch
    jobs are used to minimize human interaction and allow the
    submission and scheduling of many jobs in parallel while
    attempting to utilize the resources through a resource scheduler
    more efficiently or simply in sequential order. Batch processing
    scarce resources managed by batch queues are highly optimized and
    in many cases, provide significant performance advantages over
    other services. Disadvantages include the limited and pre-installed
    software stacks that, in some cases, do not allow the latest
    applications to run.
