  description: |-
  
    A file is a resource allowing storage of data as a traditional file
    being processed. The interface to a file provides the mechanism to
    appropriately locate a file in a distributed system. File
    identification includes the name, endpoint, checksum, and
    size. Additional parameters, such as a timestamp can
    also be stored. The interface only describes the location of the
    file.  The file object has name, endpoint (location), size in GB,
    MB, Byte, checksum for integrity check.
