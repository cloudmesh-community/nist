  description: |-
  
    Data often need to be timestamped to indicate when it has been
    accessed, created, or modified. All objects defined in this
    document will have, in their final version, a timestamp.
    The date-time string is defined in
    [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14).
