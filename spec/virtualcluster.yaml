  title: Virtual Cluster
  description: |-

    A Virtual Cluster is modeled as manager node, and one or more
    compute nodes. The manager node usually serves as a login node and
    can be accessed from outside via a public IP. The compute nodes are
    connected to the manager node via a private, usually high performance (high
    throughput and low latency) network and thus accessible only from the
    manager node. To use the virtual cluster, login to the manager node, and
    from there one can login to any compute node, or submit a job to run on the
    compute nodes.
