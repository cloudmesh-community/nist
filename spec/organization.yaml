  title: Organization
  description: |-
  
    An important concept in many services is the management of a group
    of users in an organization that includes big data services. User
    management within an organization can be achieved through several
    concepts. First, it can be achieved by defining the
    organization. Second, this organization contains a number of
    users.  Third, users within the organization can have a variety of
    roles and be separated in variopus groups.  These roles and groups
    are used for example to distinguish different access rights to
    services.
